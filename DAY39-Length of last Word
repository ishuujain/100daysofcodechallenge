PROBLEM:

Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.

A word is a maximal 
substring
 consisting of non-space characters only.

 Example 1:

Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5
Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.
Example 2:

Input: s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "
Output: 4
Explanation: The last word is "moon" with length 4.

SOLUTION:
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLastWord(string s) { 
        int len = 0, tail = s.length() - 1;
        while (tail >= 0 && s[tail] == ' ') tail--;
        while (tail >= 0 && s[tail] != ' ') {
            len++;
            tail--;
        }
        return len;
    }
};
