PROBLEM:

You are given a string s and an integer array indices of the same length. 
The string s will be shuffled such that the character at the ith position moves to indices[i] in the shuffled string.

Return the shuffled string.

Example 1:

Input: s = "codeleet", indices = [4,5,6,7,0,2,1,3]
Output: "leetcode"
Explanation: As shown, "codeleet" becomes "leetcode" after shuffling.

Example 2:

Input: s = "abc", indices = [0,1,2]
Output: "abc"
Explanation: After shuffling, each character remains in its position.

SOLUTION:

class Solution {
    public String restoreString(String s, int[] indices) {
        int n=s.length();
        char c[]=new char[n];
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            c[indices[i]]=s.charAt(i);
        }
        String a="";
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            a=a+c[i];
        }
        return a;
    }
}
